* How to convert RB3 customs to RB2, without Magma v1 *

First, grab from the RB3 CON file:
- midi
- mogg
- songs.dta
- .png_xbox

Next edit your midi file.
- You can convert your VENUE to RB2 format with the Wii converter in C3 CON Tools
- Remove any RB3 added stuff:
  - keys/prokeys (or rename keys to gtr or bass, and fix overlapping sustains)
  - harmonies
  - trill/tremolo/drum-rolls
  - drum animation events:
    - snare soft hits with either hand
    - ride left hand hit
    - crash 2 (near ride) left hand hit (either hard or soft)
  - lyric/range shift notes on vocals
  - bass solos
  - don't need to remove pro drums tom markers
- Convert section events from [prc_verse_foo] to [section verse_foo]
- Fix partial unisons

Next make your RB2 songs.dta. Here is the exact format I have been following...

(
   THESONGID ; this can be a number or alphanumeric
   (
      'name'
      "Song title goes here"
      ; copy from rb3 songs.dta
   )
   (
      'artist'
      "Artist goes here"
      ; copy from rb3 songs.dta
   )
   ('master' 1)
   (
      'song'
      (
         'name'
         "songs/THESONGFILENAME/THESONGFILENAME"
         ; this should match how your files are named
      )
      ; Magma puts a 'tracks_count' key here but it's unnecessary
      (
         'tracks'
         ; Copy this from rb3 songs.dta.
         ; Remove 'keys' if present.
         ; (or rename 'keys' to 'guitar' or 'bass' if you did that)
         (
            (
               'drum'
               (0 1)
            )
            (
               'bass'

            )
            (
               'guitar'
               (4 5)
            )
            (
               'vocals'
               (6 7)
            )
         )
      )
      (
         'pans'
         ; copy this directly from rb3 songs.dta

      )
      (

      (

         (-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1)
         ; copy this directly from rb3 songs.dta
      )
      (
         'drum_solo'
         (
            'seqs'
            ('kick.cue' 'snare.cue' 'tom1.cue' 'tom2.cue' 'crash.cue')
         )
      )
      (
         'drum_freestyle'

            'seqs'
            ('kick.cue' 'snare.cue' 'hat.cue' 'ride.cue' 'crash.cue')
         )
      )
      (
         'midi_file'
         "songs/THESONGFILENAME/THESONGFILENAME.mid"
         ; again, should match how your midi file is named
      )
   )
   ('song_scroll_speed' 2300) ; can copy from rb3 songs.dta
   (
      'bank'
      "sfx/tambourine_bank.milo"
      ; copy from rb3 songs.dta
   )
   ('anim_tempo' 32) ; copy from rb3 songs.dta
   ('song_length' 238163) ; copy from rb3 songs.dta

      ('guitar' 406)
      ('bass' 166)
      ('vocals' 0)
      ('band' 383)
   )
   ('genre' 'metal') ; copy from rb3 songs.dta. some genres are different, see below
   ('decade' 'the00s')
   ; ^ not sure if necessary. fill in with decade that matches year_released:
   ; 'the60s' 'the70s' 'the80s' 'the90s' 'the00s' 'the10s'
   ('vocal_gender' 'male') ; copy from rb3 songs.dta.
   ('version' 0)
   ('downloaded' 1)
   ('format' 4)
   ('album_art' 1)
   ('year_released' 2006) ; copy from rb3 songs.dta
   ('base_points' 0) ; just leave as 0. not necessary to pre-calculate
   ('rating' 4) ; copy from rb3 songs.dta
   ('sub_genre' 'subgenre_other') ; copy from rb3 songs.dta. some genres are different, see below
   ('song_id' THESONGID)
   ('tuning_offset_cents' 0.00) ; copy from rb3 songs.dta
   ('context' 2000)
   ('game_origin' 'rb2')
   (
      'album_name'
      "Album name goes here" ; copy from rb3 songs.dta
   )
   ('album_track_number' 69) ; copy from rb3 songs.dta
)

Finally, put it all together like so:
songs/songs.dta ; your new rb2 songs.dta
songs/THESONGFILENAME/THESONGFILENAME.mid ; your new rb2 midi
songs/THESONGFILENAME/THESONGFILENAME.mogg ; mogg straight from rb3. even encrypted ones work!
songs/THESONGFILENAME/THESONGFILENAME.pan ; empty file.
songs/THESONGFILENAME/gen/THESONGFILENAME_keep.png_xbox ; straight from rb3
songs/THESONGFILENAME/gen/THESONGFILENAME.milo_xbox ; provided, see link
songs/THESONGFILENAME/gen/THESONGFILENAME_weights.bin ; provided, see link

Glue it all together into a CON STFS package with the RB2 game ID, and you should be done!
Make sure you are on the latest RB2 update, or else songs without vocals can freeze the game.
